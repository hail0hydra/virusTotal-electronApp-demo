# virustotal returns

- I am just replicating [my python app](https://github.com/hail0hydra/pyVTFile) that I made with tkinter for VirusTotal API.


- I am trying out `Electron` while learning JS.

## usage


- create a `.env` in the root of the project and app your ___virusTotal API KEY___


```
//.env

VT_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## themes

- although you can design your own theme in css, I have some file in the `./skeleton` directory. you can rename any of them as _index.html_ and hit play
