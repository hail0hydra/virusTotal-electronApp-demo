# virustotal returns

<br>

![vt](./.git/vt.png)


- I am just replicating [my python app](https://github.com/hail0hydra/pyVTFile) that I made with tkinter for VirusTotal API.


- I am trying out `Electron` while learning JS.

<br>

> DISCLAIMER: no refreshing, no updating, no super stuff implemented. this was my first ever electron project and I dont know much js so this is a big achievement for me. If you feel you can improve this. go ahead. thank you

## usage


- create a `.env` in the root of the project and add your ___virusTotal API KEY___ (free to get)


```
//.env

VT_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## themes

- although you can design your own theme in css, I have some file in the `./skeleton` directory. you can rename any of them as _index.html_ and hit play
